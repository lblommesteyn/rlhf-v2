As a consequence, demand in our category began to slow in the Spring to early Summer of 2022 just as the supply chain congestion eased and inventory levels recovered materially. While this put pressure on the topline for retailers across the industry - ourselves included - we also saw several of the factors that drove the headwinds we experienced starting in the second half of 2021 begin to unwind. First, availability improved as more of the best products were back in stock. Second, during the summer, suppliers increasingly leaned into CastleGate once more to forward position goods, with the combination of optimized delivery speeds and lower shipping costs leading to sharper retail prices and the opportunity to drive higher sales. Finally, as suppliers and retailers everywhere realized they had significantly overbuilt inventories, and with key input costs such as ocean freight now much lower, suppliers started to discount their items via lower wholesales in order to further drive demand for their products. These factors, in conjunction with inflation easing as energy and other direct input prices moderated in the late Fall, enabled us to deliver more competitive prices for consumer.",
